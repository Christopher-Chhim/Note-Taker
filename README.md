# Note-Taker

## Description

My motivation in developing this project was to create a note-taking template so I can organize my thoughts. This is my first time using express.js so I wanted to implement its functionality to generate a note-taking app. This application will use Express.js for the back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. This is also my first time working with insomnia to create routes and endpoints to modify the middleware of an API. This note-taking app helps those that need help in organizing their apps while also helping them gain an understanding on how to work with the back end.

## Tests

Type whatever you like and see if your note is being generated on the left-hand side. Make sure to check that the generated note corresponds to your input and if there are existing notes in that same column due to prior input.
